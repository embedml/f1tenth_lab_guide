# Welcome!

Hi! Welcome to *A Friendly Solution Guide to F1Tenth Labs*! We hope this guide will make
it easy to get started with ROS (the Robot Operating System) and the F1Tenth Labs.

## Who We Are

This page is courtesy of North Carolina State University's Embedded Machine Learning Club!

## A Quick Guide to Navigating this Book
To the left, on the summary list, you can find all the chapters, subchapters, and whatnot
that this book is comprised of! At the top of the page, next to the sidebar, you will find a
hamburger menu, a paintbrush, and a magnifying glass. The hamburger menu allows you to
collapse the sidebar, the paint brush lets you change the theme, and the magnifying glass
allows you to search all the textin this book!

## Things to Know!

This guide will be using ROS Noetic, so we uh highly recommend using it. Though a fair amount of
ROS stuff should stay consistent between versions, you may have to do some extra research to get
stuff up and running.

With that out of the way, let's move on to setting up our development environment!
